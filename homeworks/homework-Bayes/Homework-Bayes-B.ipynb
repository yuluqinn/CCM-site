    "People can reason in very flexible and sophisticated ways. Let's consider an example that was introduced in Gerstenberg and Goodman (2012; see below for reference). Imagine that Brenden and Todd are playing tennis together, and Brenden wins the game. You might suspect that Brenden is a strong player, but you may also not think much of it, since it was only one game and we don't know much about Todd's ability.\n",

Probabilistic programs are a powerful way to write Bayesian models, and they are especially useful when the prior distribution is more complex than a list of hypotheses, or is inconvenient to represent with a probabilistic graphical model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic programming is an active area of research. There are specially designed probabilistic programming languages such as [WebPPL](http://webppl.org/). Other languages have been introduced that combine aspects of probabilistic programming and neural networks, such as [Pyro](http://pyro.ai/), and [Edward](http://edwardlib.org/). Rather than using a particular language, we will use vanilla Python to express an interesting probability distribution as a probabilistic program, and you will be asked to write your own rejection sampler for inference. More generally, an important component of the appeal of probabilistic programming is that when using a specialized language, you can take advantage of general algorithms for Bayesian inference without having to implement your own.\n",

    "## Probabilistic model\n",
    "\n",
    "The generative model can be described as follows. There are various players engaged in a tennis tournament. Matches can be played either as a singles match (Player A vs. Player B) or as a doubles match (Player A and Player B vs. Player C and Player D).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each player has a latent `strength` value which describes his or her skill at tennis. This quantity is unobserved for each player, and it is a persistent property in the world. Therefore, the `strength` stays the same across the entire set of matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "A match is decided by whichever team has more `team_strength`. Thus, if it's just Player A vs. Player B, the stronger player will win. If it's a doubles match, `team_strength` is the sum of the strengths determines which team will be the `winner`. However, there is an additional complication. On occasion (with probability 0.1), a player becomes `lazy`, in that he or she doesn't try very hard for this particular match. For the purpose of this match, his or her `strength` is reduced by half. Importantly, this is a temporary (non-persistent) state which is does not affect the next match.\n",
    "\n",
    "This completes our generative model of how the data is produced. In this assignment, we will use Bayesian inference to reason about latent parameters in the model, such as reasoning about a player's strength given observations of his or her performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concepts as programs\n",
    "**A powerful idea is that we can model concepts like `strength`, `lazy`, `team_strength`, `winner`, and `beat` as programs, usually simple stochastic functions that operate on inputs and produce outputs.** You will see many examples of this in the code below. Under this view, the meaning of a \"word\" comes from the semantics of the program, and how the program interact with eachother. Can all of our everyday concepts be represented as programs? It's an open question, and the excitement around probabilistic programming is that it provides a toolkit for exploring this idea."

I think in Scenario 6 A is the strongest, because as the question states: A + B > C + D, A + C > B + D, A + D > B + C,  then we can see whenver A is there, the team beats the other, thus A is the strongest. I think scenario 4 is the weakest, since we only know that AB > EF, we can infer EF is weak since it loses every game, but we don't know more about A's strength. The model agrees with my intuition. "

    "**My solution:** Yes, conditioning on temper influence our inference about Bob's strengh. When Tom and Sue both do not have tempers which infers their strength is not deducted, but bob still won, as compared to the later case when Tom and Sue's team stength is 1/4 of the normal strength. Thus Bob is stronger in the first case than the second case. As the first value is larger than the second value, it corresponds with our intuition. "
